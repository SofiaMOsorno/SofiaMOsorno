Hi, I’m @SofiaMOsorno
I’m currently a dedicated college student with a strong interest in software development, particularly in front-end technologies. 
I am eager to gather as much experience as possible in the field of software development. I believe that hands-on experience is invaluable,
and I am constantly seeking opportunities to apply what I’ve learned in real-world scenarios. Whether it’s through internships, collaborative
projects, or personal coding endeavors, I am always ready to dive into new challenges and expand my skill set.
